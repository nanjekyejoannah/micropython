The public C API
=================

The public C-API comprises functions defined in all ``C`` header files in the ``py``
directory. Most of the important core runtime C APIS are exposed in ``runtime.h`` and
``obj.h``.

The following is an example of public API functions from ``obj.h``:

.. code-block:: c

   mp_obj_t mp_obj_new_tuple(size_t n, const mp_obj_t *items);
   void mp_obj_tuple_get(mp_obj_t self_in, size_t *len, mp_obj_t **items);
   void mp_obj_tuple_del(mp_obj_t self_in);
   mp_int_t mp_obj_tuple_hash(mp_obj_t self_in);

At its core, any functions and macros in header files make up the public
API and can be used to access very low-level details of MicroPython. Static
functions in header files are fine too. They are "static" so the linker doesn't
complain about duplicate definition in in-lining fails.

Header files in the ``ports`` directory are only exposed to the functionality in
specific to a given port.
