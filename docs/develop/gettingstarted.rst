Getting Started
===============

This guide covers a step-by-step process on setting up version control, obtaining and building
a copy of the source code for a port, building the documentation, running tests and a description of the 
directory structure of the MicroPython code base.

.. note::
   For a quick developer checklist on the basics of setting up and making a contribution,
   see the :ref:`developerreference`.

Source control with Git
-----------------------

MicroPython is hosted on GitHub and uses ``git`` for source control. The workflow is such that
code is pulled and pushed to and from the main repository. Install the respective version of ``Git`` for 
your operating system to follow through the rest of the steps.

.. note::
   For a reference on the installation instructions, please refer to 
   the `Git installation instructions <https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git>`_.
   Learn about the basic git commands in this `Git Handbook <https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/>`_
   or any other sources on the internet.

Get the code
----------------

It is recommended that you maintain a fork of the MicroPython repository for your development purposes.
The process of obtaining the source code includes the following:

| Fork the repository https://github.com/micropython/micropython.git
| You will now have a fork at <https://github.com/<your-user-name>/micropython.git>.
| Clone the repository. You may clone either your fork or the main MicroPython repository.
   Use one of the commands below:

.. code-block:: console

   $ git clone https://github.com/micropython/micropython.git 
   $ git clone https://github.com/<your-user-name>/micropython.git

Depending on what you cloned, `configure the remote 
repositories <https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Working-with-Remotes>`_ to be able to
collaborate on the MicroPython project.

Configure upstream if you cloned your fork.

.. code-block:: console

   $ cd micropython
   $ git remote add upstream https://github.com/micropython/micropython.git

It is common to configure ``upstream`` and ``origin`` on a forked repository
to assist with sharing code changes. You can maintain your own mapping but
it is recommended that ``origin`` maps to your fork and ``upstream`` to the main
MicroPython repository:

.. code-block:: console

   $ cd micropython
   $ git remote add upstream https://github.com/micropython/micropython.git
   $ git remote set-url origin https://github.com/<your-user-name>/micropython.git

After the above configuration, your setup should be similar to this:

.. code-block:: console
   
   $ git remote -v
   origin	https://github.com/<your-user-name>/micropython.git (fetch)
   origin	https://github.com/<your-user-name>/micropython.git (push)
   upstream	https://github.com/micropython/micropython.git (fetch)
   upstream	https://github.com/micropython/micropython.git (push)

You should now have a copy of the source code. By default you are pointing
to the master branch. To prepare for further development, it is recommended
to work on a development branch.

.. code-block:: console

    $ git checkout -b dev-branch

You can give it any name. You will have to compile MicroPython whenever you change 
to a different branch.

Compile and build the Code
--------------------------

For development, you should compile MicroPython for a specific platform which corresponds
to a port. Start by installing the required dependencies. Then build the MicroPython 
cross-compiler before you can successfully compile and build.

Required dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before anything, make sure you have a working environment for ``gcc`` and ``GNU make``.
Ubuntu 20.04 has been used for the example below but other unixes ought to work with
little modification:

.. code-block:: console

   $ gcc --version
   gcc (Ubuntu 9.3.0-10ubuntu2) 9.3.0
   Copyright (C) 2019 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
   This is free software; see the source for copying conditions.  There is NO
   warranty; not even for MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Install the required dependencies for linux:

.. code-block:: console

   $ sudo apt-get install build-essential libreadline-dev libffi-dev git \\
   pkg-config gcc-arm-none-eabi libnewlib-arm-none-eabi

For the stm32 port, the ARM cross-compiler is required:

.. code-block:: console

   $ sudo apt-get install arm-none-eabi-gcc arm-none-eabi-binutils arm-none-eabi-newlib

Python 3 is also recommended:

.. code-block:: console

   $ python
   Python 3.5.0 (default, Jul 17 2020, 14:04:10) 
   [GCC 5.4.0 20160609] on linux
   Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
   >>> 

Build the cross-compiler
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Almost all ports require building ``mpy-cross`` first to perform pre-compilation
of scripts that will be included in the port firmware:

.. code-block:: console

   $ cd mpy-cross
   $ make

If ``mpy-cross`` built successfully, you should see a message similar to this:

.. code-block:: console

   LINK mpy-cross
      text	   data	    bss	    dec	    hex	filename
    279328	    776	    880	 280984	  44998	mpy-cross

Build for the Unix Port
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To build for the unix port, make sure all linux related dependencies are 
installed as detailed in the required dependencies section, then build:

.. code-block:: console

   $ cd ports/unix
   $ make submodules
   $ make

If MicroPython built correctly, you should see the following:

.. code-block:: console

   LINK micropython
      text	   data	    bss	    dec	    hex	filename
    412033	   5680	   2496	 420209	  66971	micropython

Now run it:

.. code-block:: console

   $ ./micropython
   MicroPython v1.13-38-gc67012d-dirty on 2020-09-13; linux version
   Use Ctrl-D to exit, Ctrl-E for paste mode
   >>> print("hello world")
   hello world
   >>>

Build for the stm32 port
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Like the unix port, you need to install some required dependencies
as detailed in the required dependencies section, then build:

.. code-block:: console

   $ cd ports/stm32
   $ make submodules
   $ make

Please refer to the `stm32 documentation <https://github.com/micropython/micropython/tree/master/ports/stm32>`_ 
for more details on flashing the firmare.

Build for the Windows port
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Windows port is experimental and based on the Unix port. Build on 
debian/linux systems using the following commands:

.. code-block:: console

   $ cd ports/windows
   $ sudo apt-get install gcc-mingw-w64
   $ make CROSS_COMPILE=i686-w64-mingw32-

Then run easily with ``wine``:

.. code-block:: console

   $ wineconsole --backend=curses ./micropython.exe

Refer to the `windows port documentation <https://github.com/micropython/micropython/tree/master/ports/windows>`_
on more details on building using Cygwin and MS visual Studio 2013 or higher.

Build the documentation
------------------------

MicroPython documentation is created using ``Sphinx``. If you have already
installed Python, then install ``Sphinx`` using ``pip``:

.. code-block:: console

   $ pip install sphinx

Navigate to the ``docs`` directory:

.. code-block:: console

   $ cd docs

Build the docs:

.. code-block:: console

   $ make html

Open ``docs/build/html/index.html`` in your browser to view the docs locally. Refer to the 
documentation on `importing your documentation to use Read the Docs
<https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/intro/import-guide.html>`_.

Run the tests
-------------

To run all tests in the testsuite, use ``make``:

.. code-block:: console

   $ make test

.. warning::
   Make sure you are in the port directory where MicroPython was built before running the tests. 
   Running the tests outside your port will not work.

Folder structure
----------------

There are a couple of directories to take note of in terms of where certain implementation details
are. The following is a break down of the top-level folders in the source code.

``py``

Contains the the compiler, runtime and core library implementation.

``mpy-cross``

Has the MicroPython cross-compiler which pre-compiles the Python scripts to bytecode.

``ports``

Code for all the versions of MicroPython for the supported ports.

``lib``

Low-level C libraries used by any port.

``drivers``

Has drivers for specific hardware and intended to work across multiple ports.

``extmod``

Contains a C implementation of more non-core modules.

``docs``

Has the standard documentation found at https://docs.micropython.org/.

``tests``

An implementation of the test suite.

``tools``

Contains helper tools including the ``upip`` and the ``pyboard.py`` module.

``examples``

Example Python scripts.
